Enahancements :


-> We can add spring security starter and implement JWT for securing api's like account creation, account deletion,
   balance transfer operation as per user roles & responsibilities.

-> We can integrate RDBMS database like adding client jar and spring JPA for Database management rather storing the records in a concurrenthashmap.

-> We can apply spring transaction in order to support transaction & its rollback over the database transaction related work like balance transfer,
   storing newly created account like operations.

-> We can implement kafka support for sending notification to other application in asynchronous mode.
